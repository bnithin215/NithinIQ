## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)
- Firebase account
- OpenAI API key

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NithinIQ.git
cd NithinIQ
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**Important**: You must configure your API keys before running the application.

1. Copy the example environment files:
   ```bash
   cp src/environments/environment.example.ts src/environments/environment.ts
   cp src/environments/environment.prod.example.ts src/environments/environment.prod.ts
   ```

2. Edit `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`:
   - Add your Firebase configuration
   - Add your OpenAI API key

3. See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### 4. Configure Firebase

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication methods:
   - Email/Password
   - Google Sign-In
   - Anonymous (optional)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Deploy Firestore security rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Security

**Never commit your API keys to version control!**

- Environment files with placeholder values are committed to the repository
- Add your actual API keys locally in `src/environments/environment.ts`
- See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for security best practices

## Documentation

- [Environment Setup Guide](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) - Detailed environment configuration and security best practices

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run end-to-end tests:
```bash
npm run e2e
```

## Deployment

### Firebase Hosting

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Configure Firebase (if not already done):
   - Create a `firebase.json` configuration file for Firebase Hosting
   - Configure Firestore rules and indexes as needed

3. Deploy to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```
